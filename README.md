Umbraco Code Generation

C# code generator to generate Models (POCOâ€™s) for Umbraco Document Types using T4 templates. These Models can be populated with data from Umbraco nodes via the generated ModelFactory class. The major Umbraco Data Types are supported including some uComponent Data Types like DataType Grid. Ideal when Razor or Mustache is used as view engine.
