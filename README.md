Umbraco Code Generation

C# code generator for Umbraco Document Types using T4 templates. The generated Models are essentially POCOâ€™s. 
A ModelFactory class is generated to populate these models with data from Umbraco nodes. 
The major Umbraco Data Types are supported as well as some uComponent Data Types like DataType Grid.
Ideal when Razor or Mustache is used as view engine.
